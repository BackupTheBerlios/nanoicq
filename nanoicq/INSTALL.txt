At this moment (version 0.1.2) it's impossible to install nanoicq
using standart Python way - using 'setup.py'. The only way to
setup it right now is to simply unpack somewhere in directory, for
example in '$HOME/nanoicq' and run it using '$HOME/nanoicq/nanoicq.py'.

This is quite unnatural and must be fixed in near future.
